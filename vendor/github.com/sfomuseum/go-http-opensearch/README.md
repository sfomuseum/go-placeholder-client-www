# go-http-opensearch

Go package to implement an OpenSearch HTTP middleware handler.

## Important

* Documentation to follow. In the meantime have a look at [_examples/server](_examples/server/main.go).
* As of this writing only a limited subset of `OpenSearch` is implemented, specifically just enough to work with [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/OpenSearch).
